# Antonio Cornieles | Kemuri BioSim Demo

**BioSim** is a Python-based computational biology tool designed to:

- Fetch nucleotide sequences from NCBI  
- Download and visualize 3D protein structures (PDB files)  
- Build interactive nucleotide helices  
- Simulate enzyme kinetics with competitive inhibition  
- Generate optional AI-assisted explanations of reactions  

It serves both as an **educational tool** and a **portfolio demonstration** of interactive bioinformatics workflows.

## **Features**

- Automated sequence retrieval and storage in FASTA format
- Download and parse PDB structures from RCSB
- Generate 3D protein visualizations with interactive HTML output
- Build nucleotide helix plots in 3D
- Simulate enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten) with and without competitive inhibitors
- Optional AI explanations using OpenAI API (GPT models)
- Saves all outputs for reproducibility

## **Demo Overview**

- **Enzyme simulated:** Neuraminidase (H1N1 influenza virus)  
- **Substrate:** Sialic acid analog  
- **Inhibitor:** Competitive inhibitor (drug analog, e.g., Tamiflu)  
- **Visualizations:** 3D protein structure and nucleotide helix  
- **Simulation:** Product formation over time, with and without inhibitor  
- **AI summary:** Natural-language explanation of reaction kinetics (optional)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a **simplified educational model**. It focuses on enzyme kinetics, not the immune response or full viral life cycle.
